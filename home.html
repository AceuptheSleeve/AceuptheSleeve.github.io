            <p class = "textbox">
                My name is Kameron Tiah Carter. 
                I am an 19-year-old recently graduated student from Olentangy High School (OHS) and Delaware Area Career Center (DACC). 
                I am compatible with all types of people. 
                I work well as a leader due to my reliability, diligence, and determination. 
                As a team member, I am steadfast in my convictions yet still approachable and willing to consider alternative viewpoints. 
                During my high school tenure, my hard work got me an invitation to member of National Society of High School Scholars.
